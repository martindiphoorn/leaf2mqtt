# Leaf2Mqqt

**Caution: this project is in an early stage! However i use it daily.**

This project will use carwings for retrieving the data from the API. It is based on many online projects. Many thanks for the inspiration to create this.

It will poll data every 10 minutes.   

Targets for this project:   
- Docker image that is fully configurable by env settings
- Send data to MQTT
- Polls from API
- Docker compose example for easy implementation
- Python 3

This project is an example how things can work. I'm not responsible for any damage in any way.

The image can be found on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/martindiphoorn/leaf2mqtt)
